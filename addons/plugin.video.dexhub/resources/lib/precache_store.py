"""
DexHub pre-cache store — holds silently-scraped stream entries for the NEXT
episode so the source picker is instant when the user finishes the current one.

Architecture:
  - In-memory dict keyed by (canonical_id, season, episode) -> (expires_at, entries)
  - Cache lives for the Kodi process; clears on restart
  - 30-minute TTL is long enough for a full episode binge, short enough that a
    user returning hours later still gets a fresh scrape
  - Thread-safe via a single lock; `consume()` removes after read so a single
    pre-cache slot is never reused for a different play session

NO UI, NO Kodi calls — this module is pure data. The producer (background
thread in plugin.py) writes results here; the consumer (`episode_streams` at
the top of its function body) reads them and skips network scraping when hot.
