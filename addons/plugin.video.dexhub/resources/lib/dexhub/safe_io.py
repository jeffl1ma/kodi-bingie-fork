"""Atomic, crash-safe state I/O helpers.

Every JSON state file in DexHub (providers, sessions, Trakt tokens,
collection sets, source preferences, next-up cache, …) goes through
this module so the same crash-safety guarantees apply everywhere:

  * Writes are atomic — a power loss or process kill never leaves a
    half-written file behind.
  * Each successful write also leaves a `.bak` snapshot of the previous
    contents, so the most recent known-good version is recoverable
    even if disk corruption hits the primary file later.
  * Reads automatically recover from `.bak` when the primary is
    unreadable, log a clear warning, and restore the backup as the
    new primary so the next call is clean.

Introduced in v3.9.17 to fix "all my sources disappeared after a
power loss" — the addon's previous `with open('w')` writes were not
crash-safe.
