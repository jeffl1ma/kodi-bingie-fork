"""Session store for active playback context.

Uses Kodi's Home window properties as the primary store (RAM, ~100x faster
than disk on every read/write). Falls back to a profile JSON file only when
xbmcgui isn't available (rare — happens during very early service startup
before the GUI is initialized).

The session is consulted on every progress tick by CompanionPlayer, so the
property-vs-file difference compounds quickly.
