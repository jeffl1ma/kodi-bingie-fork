"""Per-library sort preference (Plex + Emby).

Before v3.9.232 the sort was a pure URL parameter.  Each context-menu entry did
a `Container.Update` with `sort=...` baked into the URL and nothing was ever
stored, so:

  * the library TILE always opened with `sort=''` (Plex) / `'SortName'` (Emby),
  * walking back into a library reset the order,
  * the user had to re-pick the sort every single time.

This stores the chosen sort per (backend, server, library) so a library reopens
the way the user left it.  A tiny JSON file is enough — there are only ever a
handful of libraries, and it keeps the choice readable/removable by hand.

`reuselanguageinvoker=true` NOTE
    Dex Hub runs with a WARM Python VM: module-level state survives across
    plugin invocations.  A naive `_MEM = None` module cache would be populated
    once and never refreshed, so an invocation that cached an EMPTY store would
    keep returning the default even after the chooser wrote a sort — i.e. the
    exact bug this module exists to fix would come back through the cache.

    So the cache is keyed on the file's (mtime, size): a warm VM picks up a
    choice written by any other invocation, while still avoiding a disk read on
    every call.  `profile_path()` is likewise resolved lazily rather than frozen
    at import time.
